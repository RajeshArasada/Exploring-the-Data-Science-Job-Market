LOCATION: Center for Health Research

DEPARTMENT: Research

WORK SCHEDULE: Days

WORK TYPE: Full Time

JOB SUMMARY:

Geisinger Health System’s Neuroscience Institute is seeking early-career investigators with a strong background in computational intelligence as well as a creative and innovative approach to applied data analytics for a position as an early career investigator with its newly-developed Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group. This group will be directed by a clinical neurosurgeon with academic interest and experience in data science and predictive analytics who is tasked with developing novel methods to use complex, integrated healthcare datasets to individualize and to optimize the care of patients with neurologic disease. The team will work collaboratively on joint projects and will leverage the unique talents of its individual members to develop data models that can be directly and promptly implemented in a clinical setting to improve patient care.

The group will be based at Geisinger’s newly-developed Center for High Performance Medical Computing. In addition to individual high-performance workstations, the investigator will have unencumbered access to a new computational cluster with 384 CPU cores / 32 GPUs / 2.2 TB RAM running RedHat LINUX and a high-performance storage server with 248TB of disk storage running Hadoop and SQL databases over a GPFS file system. Matlab and Matlab DCS are deployed on this cluster, as are most other standard scientific and mathematical computing software packages.

As a member of the Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group, the investigator (and the remainder of the team) will be supported by a scientific programmer dedicated to the operations of the research group as well as by a computational cluster administrator and a database programmer who are dedicated full-time to the Center for High Performance Medical Computing. These resources will prevent the investigator from having to spend valuable time performing system administration or routine programming tasks and will instead allow their unique skills to be focused exclusively on the research group’s academic mission of investigation and development.

The projects that the group will undertake will involve using heterogeneous, large-volume databases (including clinical, imaging, molecular, and economic data) in conjunction with current and novel predictive analytics methods to individualize the delivery of healthcare, to optimize patient management strategies, to provide data-driven decision support to clinicians treating patients with neurologic disease, and to address challenges associated with efficiency of the process of healthcare delivery on an institutional level. The machine learning / computational intelligence investigator will focus specifically on building algorithms that are capable of learning and improving in response to the real-time data stream that is continuously generated during the routine course of clinical practice in a large academic medical center.

As an integral part of the research team who is critical to the hypothesis generation and innovation processes, the investigator will also have opportunities to interface with the clinical / patient care environment. The investigator will be encouraged to attend tumor boards, outpatient clinics, and selected inpatient medical and surgical activities in order to better understand the nature of the questions needing to be addressed and of the environment in which the models and tools developed by the group will be implemented.

Considerable emphasis is placed on practical implementation of the strategies, tools, and techniques developed by the group, making this more than just a traditional academic research engagement. While publications, presentations, and other standard research metrics will be part of the ongoing assessment of the investigator’s performance, significant value will also be placed on the practical utility and successful clinical implementation of the models and tools developed by the group. Together, these characteristics represent a unique opportunity for a machine learning investigator with a strong interest in real-world medical applications of data science.

This position reports directly to the clinician / data scientist who serves in the dual roles of (1) director of the Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group, and (2) co-director of the Center for High-Performance Medical Computing.

COMPETENCIES AND SKILLS:

• Proficiency with the theory and applications of common machine learning and computational intelligence algorithms, strategies, and methods

• Proficiency with coding machine learning / computational intelligence applications in common mathematical / scientific computing languages (e.g. Matlab, R)

• Proficiency with predictive analytic methods, including data modeling and regression methods

• Experience writing and publishing academic manuscripts in domain-relevant journals

• Fluency in writing and speaking the English language

• Creative and innovative thinking with a focus on novel approaches to solving computational and analytic challenges

• An interest in working collaboratively and contributing intellectually to a team of physicians, mathematicians, and programmers working to apply complex analytic methods to clinically-relevant problems related to optimizing patient care

• Experience / Proficiency with developing and testing machine learning / computational intelligence methods in a distributed / parallel computing environment

• Experience / Proficiency with methods for dimensionality reduction

• Experience / Proficiency with classification, including kernel-based classifiers

• Experience / Proficiency with real-time data stream analysis

• Experience / Proficiency with model-based optimization problems and applications

• Experience / proficiency with advanced statistics

• Experience / Proficiency with developing graphical user interfaces (stand-alone and web-based) that facilitate straightforward application of machine learning models.

• Experience writing academic grants and/or securing external funding

EDUCATION AND/OR EXPERIENCE:
