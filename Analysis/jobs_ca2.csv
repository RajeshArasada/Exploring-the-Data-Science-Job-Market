0,"Evil exists and fortunately we're here to stop it! Fraud and abuse plague online businesses of all types and in various forms (i.e. payment fraud, content and promotional abuse, account takeover, chargebacks). As the internet's trust layer, Sift Science's mission is simple yet powerful: make these online experiences faster, smoother, and safer using the smartest technology around. We are looking for passionate, technically agile new grads who have the ability to dive into tough problems and are eager to take on and learn new skills.

At Sift Science, engineers build our products soup-to-nuts, or, if you prefer, bits-to-pixels. Our stack is built primarily in Java using Hadoop, HDFS, and HBase. As you can see, we love open source, but we don't shy away from building our own technology when the best available isn't good enough. As a New Grad Engineer at Sift, you will work on a variety of technical problems (front-end, back-end, data-science, full-stack) that span our entire product and internal infrastructure.

What you'll do

Some of the complex and challenging problems our engineering teams work on are:

Infrastructure - Infrastructure is the backbone of everything we do at Sift. Examples of projects include finding and removing performance bottlenecks, scaling databases, building a framework for feature extraction, and server architecture and administration.

Machine learning - We fight fraud with machine learning and our approach is unique. We train our models on millions of transactions across hundreds of customer sites, with countless features extracted from each.

Applications - The best infrastructure and machine learning techniques are meaningless without applications that put them to good use. Our API platform enables our customers to get value from Sift Science within minutes of signing up, and our front-end Console product summarizes our predictions in ways that are instantly actionable.

What makes you a good fit
Graduating in 2019 with a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Computer Science or related field
Previous internship experience in software engineering
Proficiency in a dynamic programming language such as Java or Python
Proactive nature, and the ability to continually learn from your experiences

Description of Institution and Library

As one of the world's great public research universities, UCLA integrates education, research, and public service so that each enriches and extends the others. From its beautiful neighborhood campus in a uniquely diverse and vibrant city on the Pacific Rim, teaching and research extend beyond the classroom, office, and lab through active engagement with communities, organizations, projects, and partnerships throughout the region and around the world.

UCLA's diverse community of scholars encompasses nearly 30,000 undergraduates pursuing 125 majors, 13,000 graduate students in fifty-nine research programs, and 4,000 faculty members including Nobel Laureates; Rhodes Scholars; MacArthur Fellows; winners of the Fields Medal, National Medal of Science, Pritzker Prize, and Pulitzer Prize; and recipients of Oscars, Emmys, Tonys, and Golden Globes. UCLA ranks tenth in the Times of London Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, twelfth in the Academic Ranking of World Universities by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and fifth in the U.S. by Washington Monthly. The National Research Council ranks forty of its graduate and doctoral research programs among its top ten.

To enable these accomplished students, faculty, and staff to create, disseminate, and apply knowledge for the benefit of global society, the UCLA Library is re-envisioning how it is acquired, synthesized, and shared across academic audiences and with the public. It was among the first academic libraries to develop subject-specialist librarians and to launch a program to enhance students' research skills. Its Special Collections pioneered the acquisition by public institutions of rare and unique books, children's literature, pulp and detective fiction, works by or about women and minorities, screenplays, architectural plans, and Los Angeles-related materials and today leads the way in collecting archival resources in digital format such as emails and manuscripts. It has launched innovative data management services and an affordable course materials initiative that have served as models for other libraries.

The Library serves UCLA students, faculty, and staff whenever and wherever they need its resources and expertise. Reconfigured, high-tech spaces and services in its ten campus libraries enable users and librarians to explore and work with print and digital materials collaboratively or individually, pursue new lines of inquiry, and develop new pedagogical approaches as well as novel forms of scholarship. More than 3.5 million people visit annually, while an additional 3.4 million visitors enter online through its virtual front doors.

Whether on campus or online, the Library forms the intellectual heart of UCLA, a hub for cutting-edge discovery, scholarship, and instruction.

Description of Unit

The Data Science Center (DSC) supports researchers with acquiring, cleaning, using/reusing, publishing, and preserving data. The DSC provides consulting and instruction on a range of tools and leading practices supporting data-intensive scholarship, including R, Python, research data management, and reproducible science. The DCS develops, runs, and maintains research applications that help researchers and learners collaborate on, manage, share, and steward their research objects. The DSC manages the Social Science Data Archive historic data collections and continues its archival mission as part of the Library.

When did you last integrate with an API? Was it fun or frustrating? Were there straightforward docs, recommendations on best practices for your needs, error messages pointing toward resolution, and dashboards to show you if everything's okay? Did you feel awesome for how much you were able to get done so quickly? Our goal is to get our customers up and running fast and in a way that serves their needs.

We then ensure that internal ML teams can use that data well to predict which users our customers can trust.

What you'll do:
Make it faster and easier for developers to send data to Sift Science by intelligently designing APIs, building web applications that provide insights to developers on the health of their integration, and designing notification systems that can proactively notify us and our customers when something's gone wrong.
Build the frameworks that underlie these applications by designing systems for data aggregation and analysis, automated anomaly detection and forecasting. Understand the relationship between API fields and ML signals in order to provide data-driven integration recommendations.
Understand the needs of Sift's ML teams and create useful abstractions on top of customer data, such as device identification and fingerprinting
Build rock-solid external-facing software that our customers can trust to be error-free and performant, including client libraries in Ruby, PHP, Java and Python; iOS and Android SDKs; a JavaScript SDK and highly available API servers taking thousands of requests per second.
What would make you a strong fit:
3+ years software engineering experience working primarily in backend systems using languages like Java, C++, C# or Go.
You've driven end-to-end design, implementation, launch and ongoing support for a business-critical production system, and are the go-to expert for it.
You care about understanding your customer and building what they need. You proactively find ways to learn about how to better serve customers both internal and external. You can develop an opinion on how to help, and communicate it well.
You're adept at learning new technologies and working across a broad technology stack. There's no shortage of things to learn.
A little about us:

Sift Science is a hyper-growth Series D company that facilitates the largest trust network of online businesses and consumers on the internet.

The Sift Science Trust PlatformTM uses real-time machine learning to accurately predict which users businesses can trust, and which ones they can't. The upshot?
