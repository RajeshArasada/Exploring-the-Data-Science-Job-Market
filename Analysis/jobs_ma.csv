Imagine turning your passion for Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence into insights, predictions and actions that could help develop medicines that change lives. Pushing the frontiers of innovation. Collaborating with some of the finest minds in their fields. Working in an environment that stimulates your curiosity, and enables you to develop your expertise and reach your potential.

AstraZeneca is a global, science led biopharmaceutical business and our innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide. Artificial Intelligence (AI), including deep learning (computer algorithms inspired by biological neural networks), is revolutionising all stages of drug discovery and development from drug design to pivotal clinical trials and beyond. At AstraZeneca, we are deploying AI across the drug discovery phases to discover new connections between data, provide novel insights, accelerate scientific understanding, and increase productivity. For example, we are using AI to help design and synthesise new drug molecules, analyse and interpret the vast amount of data from imaging studies, and for biomarker research to match the right drug to the right patient. In our clinical trials, AI is also enabling us to continuously monitor incoming safety data and alert our scientists to safety signals that need attention.

As a Data Scientist and AI Graduate you will help our scientists make their data AI-ready, and integrate the latest AI advances into all our drug development programmes. Together we will harness the power of our data and AI to deliver life-changing medicines to patients worldwide.

What does the programme involve?

Your two-year programme begins with an introduction to drug discovery, and how we harness the potential of Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Youll then select two eight-month placements where youll apply your developing skills and experience to help us overcome challenges in some of our active research projects. Your placements will help you develop your technical skills and industry knowledge, and on our Global Graduate Development Programme youll develop the interpersonal and business skills that will set you up for success.Throughout the programme youll work alongside our experts, and take advantage of our close collaborations with leading international academic institutions and organisations to deliver work with real impact.

Placements could involve
Applying the latest techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence to preclinical data from drug projects to help detect and understand safety risks and guide the development of new medicines. Exciting work which could also help us refine, reduce and replace animal experiments.
Combining innovative de novo molecule design methodologies utilizing state-of-the-art artificial intelligent technologies with chemistry automation to design novel molecules of therapeutic interest.
Working with our Quantitative Clinical Pharmacology Team to optimize clinical development programs using Bayesian statistic and machine learning modelling.

7,"Not just another start-up, we fight fraud!

At Shift Technology we are proud to have a purpose: to help insurers weed out claims corruption. Our SaaS solution, which leverages Big Data and AI, has been used to unravel fraud networks across Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
If you are someone motivated by meaningful work, Shift Technology may just be the spot for you!

Your day-to-day

At Shift Technology, we are constantly looking for new ways to innovate. Fraud landscapes are in constant motion and in order to ensure our detection methods are always one step ahead, our data scientists must be too.
Shift Technology data scientists are the central productive force of the company. They design the models, construct the features, implement the rules, and optimize the algorithms that are used throughout the data processing pipeline. They face two main challenges: messy and often incomplete data paired with complex and ever-evolving problems.
The data we collect comes in all shapes and sizes and is not, for the most part, quantitative. Insurance claims data typically includes date, location, circumstantial details, damage descriptions, and involved parties. With that wide array of information, our data scientists must be comfortable with a variety of specific approaches: unsupervised anomaly detection, temporal sequences analysis, semantic network analysis …
As for the solution, our data scientists must be able to produce predictions justified with intelligible explanations, even when very little data is available.
Our data scientists have the exciting mission of designing and implementing models that replicate and enhance real-world fraud handling deduction patterns. They are tasked with optimizing the algorithms involved in the data processing pipeline and making adjustments as fraud scenarios mature and evolve.
After a few short months of joining our data scientist team you will be able to:
Understand insurance data and fraud mechanisms;
Create the associated mathematical models;
Implement, test and optimize the associated algorithms;
Participate in workshops with the clients to gather feedback and integrate it to the models;
Continuously provide ideas to improve the solution.
Your toolkit

On the job you will be asked to code in C# so programming experience is a big advantage, but not essential if you are willing to learn fast!

Your profile

Shift Technologys data science department is filled with top performers who are committed to technical excellence, inspired by challenging projects, and always on the look-out for new learning opportunities.
If the following qualities ring true, you would fit right in at Shift Technology:
You have advanced technical skills in Applied Mathematics, preferably in machine learning and/or operations research;
You combine strong analysis with synthesis abilities and are not afraid to deal with the details;
You can write quality production code;
You don't mind meeting with clients to discuss their needs and integrate their feedback in your projects;

ButcherBox delivers 100% grass-fed beef, organic chicken, and heritage breed pork directly to your door. We are a fast paced, high growth start-up headquartered in Cambridge, MA.

Our founder was first introduced to 100% grass-fed beef through a local farmer who sold ¼ and ½ shares of cattle. After trying it, he was instantly hooked. He preferred the more natural taste and was thrilled to discover the many health advantages grass-fed beef has over ordinary grain-fed beef. So his question became, “why isn’t everyone eating this?”

After doing some research, he discovered that not everyone has access to grass-fed beef, and even if people have access, their selection is often limited to just ground beef. This helps explain why just 1% of the total beef consumed in the United States is 100% grass-fed. While the Company began only offering beef to our customers, we have since expanded to providing organic chicken and heritage breed pork.

We believe in a healthier food system where everyone has access to meat the way Nature intended: free of antibiotics and hormones, and humanely raised on open pasture.

ButcherBox exists to ensure that access to high-quality meat you can trust is easy. We provide better meat for a better you.
