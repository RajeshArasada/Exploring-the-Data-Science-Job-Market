2,"Code Pilot is replacing the crusty old resume with a data science based portfolio for engineers, and we're looking for a Software Engineer to join the family of one of our hiring partners.

We are looking for:

A new team member to support the development of a platform for one of our hiring partners.

What will keep you challenged?
Participate in the entire development process from planning the architecture to quality assurance and implementation of the platform.
Promote the design and development of new innovative features from the technical side.
Develop your own ideas for code and process improvements.
Assure the quality of the application through regular code reviews.
Share and expand your knowledge by exchanging information with our network of developers about backend best practices.
Support the integration of relevant new technologies.
Which traits contribute to your success?
Passion - for software development (algorithms, design patterns, clean code, agile processes, data structures).
Humility - Outstanding engineers display inverse proportions of talent to humility.
Mission Oriented - A dogged commitment to getting the job done is crucial.
Highly Competent - Software Engineering at the top level requires highly motivated individuals who are constantly learning and adapting.
Highly Adaptive - Mike Tyson said it best, ""Everyone has a plan 'till they get punched in the mouth."" Developing software at the top level requires incredibly adaptability and agility. Nothing ever goes the way you want, and anything valuable probably doesn't exist the way you want it.
Ship or Quit - High performance software teams have one unifying quality, they ship, a lot. So if you're a fellow Ship talker, you'll love it here.
Some technologies you will be working with:
Docker, Gitlab, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, Relational and noSQL, AWS
Why Code Pilot?

Code Pilot is a new startup and relatively unheard of. We're currently 4 people, all co-founders, based in Austin, TX. Given the rigor and process we adopt to hire engineers, you might be asking yourself, why invest your time and effort to simply apply?

We're hoping if you've reached this part of the posting, you've already noticed the care and attention we've invested in how we hire engineers. We're not interested in the instant gratification someone can provide by being able to ""code"", and frankly, as an engineer who is passionate about the craft, you shouldn't be either. We're passionate about the discipline of engineering, and what it takes to develop world class engineers. To that end, we don't care if you've got 1 year or 20 years experience, we don't care if you went to MIT or are self-taught, hell, we don't care if your favorite programming language is Ruby (although we will help you forget everything you know about it pretty quickly). What we care about is your insatiable desire to be pressure tested in a credible engineering environment that brings out your best.

Who is Code Pilot?

Code Pilot is an outlaw collective of seasoned and successful misfits. Founded by Dave Lemphers, Scott Fletcher, Caleb Jones and Cara McCarty, they bring together global experience building world class products at Enterprise companies and startups alike. Dave runs engineering, and was part of the core team that shipped the first release of Windows Azure @ Microsoft, ran Cloud Computing @ PwC, has sold multiple startups, holds 4 patents on data science, and in addition to being a co-founder and CEO @ Code Pilot, also serves as a Program CTO for Techstars.",Internet,Information Technology,"Austin, TX",Software Engineer," – El Paso, TX",TX

Position Summary
The Children’s Environmental Health Initiative (CEHI) at Rice University in Houston, Texas is seeking a motivated bilingual individual to join our outreach team to drive enrollment in the Hurricane Harvey Registry and advance the objectives of the project by developing and managing partnerships for recruitment, follow-up, and dissemination of information to the Houston community. This individual will work with Spanish speaking communities in the Houston area to advance the objectives of the Hurricane Harvey Registry project. CEHI is a research, education, and outreach program committed to fostering environments where all people can prosper. CEHI projects focus on incorporating innovative spatial analysis in combination with field-based sampling into environmental health research. CEHI maintains a deep institutional commitment to issues of social justice and thus focuses much of its work in low income and minority communities.
Hurricane Harvey made landfall on August 26th in Rockport, Texas. Unprecedented rain from the storm dumped over 50 inches on the Houston region. Ten counties were declared disaster areas due to the storm. Preliminary satellite imagery analysis indicates that 730+ square kilometers of land were flooded in Harris and Galveston counties, with a significant portion residential. The greater Houston area includes roughly 570 chemical plants, 43 Superfund sites (13 of which flooded), 9 refineries, 188 cement batch plants, 80 metal recycling facilities, as well as numerous underground storage tanks. Receding flood waters resulted in mold and potentially bacterial contamination in residential and commercial structures. The potential for health risk is clear, and the impact on housing quantity and quality is affecting lives throughout the hurricane-affected region.
The Hurricane Harvey Registry is a collaboration among The Environmental Defense Fund, Fort Bend County, Harris County Public Health, Houston Health Department, Montgomery County, and CEHI – and we hope to partner with additional counties. We are using state of the art data and exposure science to identify WHO was (and continues to be) exposed to WHAT and in so doing establish baseline understanding of the health and housing impacts from the storm. We are collecting the relevant information by enrolling people in the Hurricane Harvey Registry. This work will help to direct the continuing Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts and plan for the future.

All applicants must pass the physical fitness requirements, including medical and hearing standards and all phases of the FBI Physical Fitness Test (PFT). Selectees must be physically fit to complete training at Quantico and maintain a high level of physical fitness throughout their careers.
You will be responsible for enforcing over 300 federal statutes as well as conducting sensitive national security investigations. You'll work to develop relationships within and across communities, protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.
In an organization made up of careers like no other, being a Special Agent can be a lifelong career of uncommon days and amazing experiences.
You have great problem-solving skills, analytical skills and leadership experience, and can get things done both in a demanding team environment and independently. Your ability to adapt to changing situations and clearly communicate across management, peer groups, external communities and stakeholders contribute to your ability to keep our nation safe. You're naturally curious yet always driven to find a solution. You are detail-oriented, yet remain strategic. You know how to objectively evaluate information and make sound judgments. Honesty and integrity are more than just words you use; they are the foundation of who you are. You take pride in making a difference in the communities you serve, and bringing your background to the forefront to drive initiatives that impact our most important stakeholders: the American people.
In this role, you'll be expected to use both established and innovative approaches to tackle some of the toughest challenges of our age. This opportunity should not be taken lightly. The FBI Special Agent position requires significant commitment and dedication from you and your family, but it's an experience you'll never forget.
Though individuals of all backgrounds are highly encouraged to apply, we're specifically seeking individuals with the following skills:
• SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH (STEM): Accounting, Forensic science, computer technology, cyber security, electronics, economics, finance, biometrics, encryption, data science, information technology, mathematics, chemistry, computer forensics, biology, and more. When people say STEM, you perk up because you know they are talking about you.
• FOREIGN LANGUAGES: You may have been raised speaking a non-English language, taught it for a few years, or even participated in intensive learning before going overseas to use it. You know that your language skills can make a difference: Arabic, Yoruba, Mandarin, Tagalog, Russian, Spanish, Farsi, Punjabi, Pashtu, Urdu, and more.
• LAW: You are an experienced lawyer and seek out new and creative ways to push for change that matters. You use your background in corporate, intellectual property (IP), family, immigration, environmental, criminal, or commercial law to do good work; work that asks you think of something bigger than yourself.
• LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MILITARY: You work in law enforcement or in the military and have been making your way up the ranks for the past few years. You raise challenging questions that demand practical answers. Detective, SWAT, helicopter/jet/rescue pilot, K-9 handler, bomb tech, operational paramedic, or otherwise, when you think about your career, you know that the FBI is the next step for you.
• EDUCATION/EDUCATORS: Whether you're a college or university professor (tenured, adjunct or otherwise), a faculty member, or an elementary, middle, or high school teacher, you have a gift for relating with individuals of all ages and backgrounds. Your teaching skills make you methodical and analytical, and you can consolidate comprehensive information into strategic and analytical lesson plans. Your skills will easily translate to the Special Agent career, where you'll enhance your team's understanding of threats, vulnerabilities and gaps by investigating matters and building relationships with communities and individuals from all walks of life.

You'll be also responsible to identify improvements to make the product better and improve the developer experience.""

YOUR ROLE WILL CONSIST OF:
Design and implement new features from draft to deployment
Identify opportunities to improve the search engine
Troubleshoot issues in production environment

We're passionate about the discipline of engineering, and what it takes to develop world class engineers. To that end, we don't care if you've got 1 year or 20 years experience, we don't care if you went to MIT or are self-taught, hell, we don't care if your favorite programming language is Ruby (although we will help you forget everything you know about it pretty quickly).

20,"Company Overview

The Cognito platform from Vectra provides continuous, automated threat surveillance to proactively expose hidden and unknown cyberattackers that actively spread inside networks.

The genesis of Cognito is based on a simple principle for finding hidden threats: use an authoritative source of data and seek out the fundamental threat behaviors that cybercriminals can’t avoid when they carry out an attack.

To do this, Cognito relies on the only source of truth during a cyberattack – network traffic. Only traffic on the wire – whether in private data centers, public clouds or enterprise environments – reveals the truth with complete fidelity and independence. Low-fidelity perimeter security only shows what you’ve already seen, not the hidden attacks that were missed.

Cognito delivers a far more efficient way of analyzing network traffic at scale. Instead of traditional payload inspection, it uses AI, machine learning and behavioral traffic analysis to expose the fundamental behaviors of attackers as they spy, spread, and steal in the network – even in encrypted traffic. By automating cyberattacker detection, analysis and incident response, Cognito AI condenses days or weeks of work into minutes, reducing the threat investigation workload. For more details, see https://vectra.ai/how-it-works.

Position Overview

The Vectra Engineering team is a small and constantly growing team of individuals. We look for people that are smart, very capable technically, and have fun solving the challenges that our customers face together as a team. We believe strongly that everyone can and should have significant impacts on the growth of the product as well as the company and our culture. We believe in using the right technology for each problem and building knowledge through mentorship and other things like peer code reviews. We're excited to find others to join the team that want to work on an interesting product that solves real problems.

We're focused on bringing quality interface design to Vectra's suite of applications that run on the Cognito platform. You will have full exposure to the UI stack with a focus on building features for enterprise-level applications. This includes taking large complex data sets and creating easily understood and insightful visualizations and reports.

Responsibilities
Understand modern web app architecture and be able to develop features in JavaScript as well as implement the Python-based web server APIs that field requests and responses.

21,"Company Overview

The Cognito platform from Vectra provides continuous, automated threat surveillance to proactively expose hidden and unknown cyberattackers that actively spread inside networks.

The genesis of Cognito is based on a simple principle for finding hidden threats: use an authoritative source of data and seek out the fundamental threat behaviors that cybercriminals can’t avoid when they carry out an attack.

To do this, Cognito relies on the only source of truth during a cyberattack – network traffic. Only traffic on the wire – whether in private data centers, public clouds or enterprise environments – reveals the truth with complete fidelity and independence. Low-fidelity perimeter security only shows what you’ve already seen, not the hidden attacks that were missed.

Cognito delivers a far more efficient way of analyzing network traffic at scale. Instead of traditional payload inspection, it uses AI, machine learning and behavioral traffic analysis to expose the fundamental behaviors of attackers as they spy, spread, and steal in the network – even in encrypted traffic.

Humility - Outstanding engineers display inverse proportions of talent to humility.
Mission Oriented - A dogged commitment to getting the job done is crucial.
Highly Competent - Software Engineering at the top level requires highly motivated individuals who are constantly learning and adapting.
Highly Adaptive - Mike Tyson said it best, ""Everyone has a plan 'till they get punched in the mouth."" Developing software at the top level requires incredibly adaptability and agility. Nothing ever goes the way you want, and anything valuable probably doesn't exist the way you want it.

We're hoping if you've reached this part of the posting, you've already noticed the care and attention we've invested in how we hire engineers. We're not interested in the instant gratification someone can provide by being able to ""code"", and frankly, as an engineer who is passionate about the craft, you shouldn't be either. We're passionate about the discipline of engineering, and what it takes to develop world class engineers. To that end, we don't care if you've got 1 year or 20 years experience, we don't care if you went to MIT or are self-taught, hell, we don't care if your favorite programming language is Ruby (although we will help you forget everything you know about it pretty quickly).
